## Constants

- Can be in global scope
- Cannot be prefixed with `mut`
- Type must be declared
- Can only be set to a constant expression, no the result ofa function call or anything that could be determined at runtime

## Shadowing

- Updates the value assigned to a variable within the block scope of the "shadow".
- Reassigning as opposed to shadowing, will change the value of a variable within the variables original scope.
